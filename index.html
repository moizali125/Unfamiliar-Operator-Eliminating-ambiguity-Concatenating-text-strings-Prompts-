      <h1>Math expressions: Unfamiliar operators</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        There are several specialized math expressions you need to know. Here's
        the first one. <br />
        num++; <br />
        This is a short way of writing... <br />
        num = num + 1; <br />
        It increments the variable by 1. <br />
        You decrement using minuses instead of pluses. <br />
        num--; <br />
        You can use these expressions in an assignment. But the result may
        surprise you. <br />
        1 var num = 1; <br />
        2 var newNum = num++; <br />
        In the example above, the original value of num is assigned to newNum,
        and num is <br />
        incremented afterward. If num is originally assigned 1 in the first
        statement, the second <br />
        statement boosts its value to 2. newNum gets the original value of num,
        1. <br />
        If you place the pluses before the variable, you get a different result.
        <br />
        1 var num = 1;<br />
        2 var newNum = ++num; <br />
        In the statements above, both num and newNum wind up with a value of 2.
        <br />
        If you put the minuses after the variable, the new variable is assigned
        the original value, <br />
        and the first variable is decremented. <br />
        1 var num = 1; <br />
        2 var newNum = num--; <br />
        num is decremented to 0, and newNum gets the original value of num, 1.
        <br />
        But if you put the minuses before the variable, newNum is assigned the
        decremented, not <br />
        the original, value. Both num and newNum wind up with a value of 0.
        <br />
        1 var num = 1; <br />
        2 var newNum = --num; <br />
      </p>

      <h1>Math expressions: Eliminating ambiguity</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        Complex arithmetic expressions can pose a problem, one that you may
        remember from <br />
        high school algebra. Look at this example and tell me what the value of
        totalCost is. <br />
        var totalCost = 1 + 3 * 4; <br />
        The value of totalCost varies, depending on the order in which you do
        the arithmetic. If <br />
        you begin by adding 1 + 3, then multiply the sum by 4, totalCost has the
        value of 16. But if <br />
        you go the other way and start by multiplying 3 by 4, then add 1 to the
        product, you get 13. <br />
        In JavaScript as in algebra, the ambiguity is cleared up by precedence
        rules. As in <br />
        algebra, the rule that applies here is that multiplication operations
        are completed before <br />
        addition operations. So totalCost has the value of 13. <br />
        But you don't have to memorize JavaScript's complex precedence rules.
        You can finesse <br />
        the issue by using parentheses to eliminate ambiguity. Parens override
        all the built-in <br />
        precedence rules. They force JavaScript to complete operations enclosed
        by parens before <br />
        completing any other operations. <br />
        When you use parens to make your intentions clear to JavaScript, it also
        makes your code <br />
        easier to grasp, both for other coders and for you when you're trying to
        understand your own <br />
        code a year down the road. In this statement, the parentheses tell
        JavaScript to first multiply 3 <br />
        by 4, then add 1. The result: 13. <br />
        var totalCost = 1 + (3 * 4); <br />
        If I move the parentheses, the arithmetic is done in a different order.
        In this next statement, <br />
        the placement of the parens tells JavaScript to first add 1 and 3, then
        multiply by 4. The result <br />
        is 16. <br />
        var totalCost = (1 + 3) * 4; <br />
        Here's another example. <br />
        var resultOfComputation = (2 * 4) * 4 + 2; <br />
        By placing the first multiplication operation inside parentheses, you've
        told JavaScript to <br />
        do that operation first. But then what? The order could be.. <br />
        1. Multiply 2 by 4. <br />
        2. Multiply that product by 4. <br />
        3. Add 2 to it. <br />
        ...giving resultOfComputation a value of 34. <br />
        Or the order could be... <br />
        1. Multiply 2 by 4. <br />
        2. Multiply that product by the sum of 4 and 2. <br />
        ...giving resultOfComputation a value of 48. <br />
        The solution is more parentheses. <br />
        If you want the second multiplication to be done before the 2 is added,
        write this... <br />
        resultOfComputation = ((2 * 4) * 4) + 2; <br />
        But if you want the product of 2 times 4 to be multiplied by the number
        you get when you <br />
        total 4 and 2, write this... <br />
        resultOfComputation = (2 * 4) * (4 + 2); <br />

      <h1>Concatenating text strings</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        In Chapter 1 you learned to display a message in an alert, coding it
        this way. <br />
        alert("Thanks for your input!"); <br />
        Or you could code it this way. <br />
        1 var message = "Thanks for your input!"; <br />
        2 alert(message); <br />
        But suppose you wanted to personalize a message. In another part of your
        code you've <br />
        asked the user for her name and assigned the name that she entered to a
        variable, userName. <br />
        (You don't know how to do this yet. You'll learn how in a subsequent
        chapter.) <br />
        Now, you want to combine her name with a standard "Thanks" to produce an
        alert that <br />
        says, for example, "Thanks, Susan!" <br />
        When the user provided her name, we assigned it to the variable
        userName. This is the <br />
        code. <br />
        alert("Thanks, " + userName + "!"); <br />
        Using the plus operator, the code combines—concatenates—three elements
        into the <br />
        message: the string "Thanks, " plus the string represented by the
        variable userName plus the <br />
        string "!" <br />
        Note that the first string includes a space. Without it, the alert would
        read, <br />
        "Thanks,Susan!". <br />
        You can concatenate any combination of strings and variables, or all
        strings or all <br />
        variables. For example, I can rewrite the last example this way. <br />
        1 var message = "Thanks, "; <br />
        2 var banger = "!"; <br />
        3 alert(message + userName + banger); <br />
        Here it is, with three strings. <br />
        alert("Thanks, " + "Susan" + "!"); <br />
        You can assign a concatenation to a variable. <br />
        1 var message = "Thanks, "; <br />
        2 var userName = "Susan"; <br />
        3 var banger = "!"; <br />
        4 var customMess = message + userName + banger; <br />
        5 alert(customMess); <br />
        If you put numbers in quotes, JavaScript concatenates them as strings
        rather than adding <br />
        them. This code... <br />
        alert("2" + "2"); <br />
        ...displays the message "22". <br />
        If you mix strings and numbers... <br />
        alert("2 plus 2 equals " + 2 + 2); <br />
        ...JavaScript automatically converts the numbers to strings, and
        displays the message "2 <br />
        plus 2 equals 22". <br />
      </p>

    <div class="moiz">
      <h1>Prompts</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        A prompt box asks the user for some information and provides a response
        field for her <br />
        answer. <br />
        This code asks the user the question "Your species?" and provides a
        default answer in the <br />
        response field, "human". She can change the response. Whether she leaves
        the default response <br />
        as-is or changes it to something else, her response is assigned to the
        variable. <br />
        var spec = prompt("Your species?", "human"); <br />
        Prompt code is like alert code, with two differences. <br />
        In a prompt, you need a way to capture the user's response. That means
        you need to start <br />
        by declaring a variable, followed by an equal sign. <br />
        In a prompt, you can specify a second string. This is the default
        response that appears in <br />
        the field when the prompt displays. If the user leaves the default
        response as-is and just <br />
        clicks OK, the default response is assigned to the variable. It's up to
        you whether you <br />
        include a default response. <br />
        As you might expect, you can assign the strings to variables, then
        specify the variables <br />
        instead of strings inside the parentheses. <br />
        1 var question = "Your species?"; <br />
        2 var defaultAnswer = "human"; <br />
        3 var spec = prompt(question, defaultAnswer); <br />
        The user's response is a text string. Even if the response is a number,
        it comes back as a <br />
        string. For example, consider this code. <br />
        1 var numberOfCats = prompt("How many cats?"); <br />
        2 var tooManyCats = numberOfCats + 1; <br />
        Since you're asking for a number, and the user is presumably entering
        one, you might <br />
        expect the math in the second statement to work. For example, if the
        user enters 3, the variable <br />
        tooManyCats should have a value of 4, you might think. But no such luck.
        All responses to <br />
        prompts come back as strings. When the string, "3", is linked with a
        plus to the number, 1, <br />
        JavaScript converts the 1 to a string and concatenates. So the value of
        tooManyCats winds up <br />
        being not 4 but "31". You'll learn how to solve this problem in a
        subsequent chaper. <br />
        If the user enters nothing and clicks OK, the variable is assigned an
        empty string: "" <br />
        If the user clicks Cancel, the variable is assigned a special value,
        null. <br />
        Some coders write window.prompt instead of, simply, prompt. This is a
        highly formal <br />
        but perfectly correct way to write it. Most coders prefer the short
        form. We'll stick to the <br />
        short form in this training. <br />
        In the example above, some coders would use single rather than double
        quotation marks. <br />
        This is legal, as long as it's a matching pair. But in a case like this,
        I'll ask you to use <br />
        double quotation marks. <br />
